## Open/Closed Principle Overview

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to existing code without altering that code.

## OCP in Java

In Java, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle involves designing classes and systems in a way that allows you to extend their behavior without changing their existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and design patterns like the Strategy Pattern.

### Benefits of OCP in Java:

- **Maintainability:** Code remains stable and less prone to errors when new features are added.
- **Extensibility:** New functionality can be added by creating new classes or modules rather than modifying existing ones.
- **Reduced Risk:** Changes in one part of the system are less likely to introduce bugs in other parts.

## Example

In this repository, you will find a Java example that illustrates the Open/Closed Principle. We have created a simple example with an `OrderProcessor` class that adheres to OCP:

- `OrderProcessor` class: Responsible for processing orders. It uses a strategy pattern to allow for the addition of new order processing strategies without modifying the `OrderProcessor` class.

You can explore the code and see how the `OrderProcessor` class is designed to be open for extension (by adding new strategies) but closed for modification (the existing code doesn't change when new strategies are added).

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when applying OCP in Java:

1. **Identify Stable and Changing Parts:** Identify the parts of your codebase that are likely to change and those that are stable.
2. **Use Abstraction:** Introduce abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) to define the stable parts of your system.
3. **Implement Strategies:** Implement new functionality as separate classes that adhere to the defined abstractions.
4. **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to inject strategies into the parts of your system that need them.
